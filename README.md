# Data Structures & Algorithms - ES6

This is a follow along repo for the Princeton Course on Algorithms and Data Structure. The original course uses Java 
and thus the necessity for this repo, which reproduces the ideas in JavaScript.

Every chapter has a separate directory which are completely idependent of each other. 

The client code has been modified a bit to exclude the stdin part(which honestly seems redundant).

To run the client files do the following:

```node --experimental-modules path/to/file ```
